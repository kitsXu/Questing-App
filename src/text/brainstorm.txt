Eggs into leveling ideas
-Receive an egg on first level up?
-Receive gold on level up?
-Purchase further eggs from marketplace
-purchase items from market place?


Market Place-
(make a marketplace)

Items
-what kind of items should my dragons need?

Eggs



Future Ideas:
-make mini window like poketech watch in pokemon that shows your brood and hp levels
-if you abandon a quest, the items get higher priced.

-tie in inner world quests to real world quests somehow...
-quests in inner world could be stuff that contributes to getting eggs to sell/items for dragons
-add in dragon affection- like if you abandon quests, you lose dragons affection
